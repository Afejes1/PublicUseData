# Berenson-Eggers Type of Service (BETOS)

The BETOS crosswalk file is no longer available from CMS as of 08/26/2015.
BETOS codes are now available from the [Alpha-Numeric HCPCS files](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets/Alpha-Numeric-HCPCS.html).

However, the Alpha-Numeric HCPCS files does not include CPT codes.
So, a BETOS crosswalk derived from the Alpha-Numeric HCPCS files do not capture CPT codes.

An alternative is to use historic BETOS crosswalk files.
These files are no longer hosted at [CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/).
They are hosted here, instead.
This BETOS crosswalk files hosted in this repository were downloaded from [CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/) before they were taken offline.

Because [CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/) is no longer hosting these files,
the data files in this repository cannot be validated against the original source.
